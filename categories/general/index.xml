The first two weeks of the semester are now over, and it has been going great. Something that has been on my mind recently is &amp;ldquo;What makes a good physicist?&amp;rdquo; And by extension, these are my sort of my goals for the future to become a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; physicist, as well as a roadmap of how I plan to get there.
Now I am using the idea of &amp;ldquo;physicist&amp;rdquo; pretty specifically to me (even though I am still a graduate student).</description></item><item><title>Introducing Sometimes Physics Sometimes Math</title><link>http://www.somephyssomemath.com/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.somephyssomemath.com/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Hello! I have been thinking of making a blog of some sort for a while now, but my friend Jim finally convinced me and helped me create this one. His blog can be found here.
My goal for this blog is baked into the name of the blog, I will talk about phyics sometimes and sometimes I will talk about math. You can expect the majority of my posts going forward to be about general relativity, quantum field theory, algebra, differential geometry, or analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
