# My Notebook

Hello! This is my notebook. I am planning on writing a few sentences every few days about what I have been learning about. The hope is that in after some time I will be able to look back, and be amazed at all the different things I have learned. 

This also should help guide those who come after me. You can see the path that I took to end up where I currently am.

### January 4th

I read the DeRham Cohomology part Chris J Isham's Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists and discussed it with two colleagues. I also discussed group representations, and separating the idea of a representation of a group from the group itself.
