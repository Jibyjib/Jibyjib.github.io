# My Notebook

Hello! This is my notebook. I am planning on writing a few sentences every few days about what I have been learning about. The hope is that in after some time I will be able to look back, and be amazed at all the different things I have learned. 

This also should help guide those who come after me. You can see the path that I took to end up where I currently am.

### January 16th 2022

I have read and taken notes for Weinberg's "The Quantum Theory of Fields: Volume I" Sections 2.1 through 2.5. I have also read Srednicki's "Quantum Field Theory" chapter 35, Manipulating spinor indices, and chapter 36, Lagrangians for spinor fields. I have also made a presentation on those two chapters for the QFT course.

### January 13th 2022

Second day of classes for the semester and we covered more of Ch2 of Weinbergs "The Quantum Theory of Fields: Volume I" as well as covered some conformal field theories. In general relativity we covered foliations, Cauchy surfaces, Gauss-Codazzi relations, ADM variables and decompositions.

### January 11th 2022

Today was the first day of classes for the day, and I am taking General Relativity II, and Quantum Field Theory II. Since it was the first day, it was mainly review, but in for QFT we explored representations of the Poincare group, and that discussion followed the second chapter of Steven Weinbergs "The Quantum Theory of Fields I." In GR we discussed extrinsic curvature, such as Gauss' Theorema Egregium, and covered the prequisites to start ADM theory.

### January 10th 2022

I read and wrote notes for Chapter 34, Left- and right-handed spinor fields, of Mark Srednicki's "Quantum Field Theory."

### January 8th 2022

I read and wrote notes for Chapter 33, Representations of the Lorentz Group, of Mark Srednicki's "Quantum Field Theory."

### January 6th 2022

I wrote up my notes for the end of Chapter 3, Vector Fields and n-forms, of Chris J Isham's "Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists." 

### January 4th 2022

I read the DeRham Cohomology part Chris J Isham's "Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists" and discussed it with two colleagues. I also discussed group representations, and separating the idea of a representation of a group from the group itself.

### Pre Jan 4th 2022

At this point in my career I am in my second year of my PhD. Let me recound the different major things that would be different from someone else. 

In undergrad I majored in physics and mathematics. The math courses that I took that are relevant to me today, are proof-based linear algebra, abstract algebra, two semesters of analysis, theory of complex variables. I also took two semesters of the graduate math methods for physicist course which focused on functional analysis such as the theory of distributions, Green's functions, operators, and Hilbert spaces.

The only physics course in my undergrad that was non-standard was a course in general relativity. We went through Sean Caroll's book "Spacetime and Geometry: An introduction to General Relativity."

Once I was in graduate school, the electives I have so far taken were the first semester of general relativity as well as the first semester of quantum field theory. For general relativity we used Carroll's book as the main text, but frequently deviated from it. We used tetrads frequently which do not appear in that text. For QFT we focused on the spin zero section of Mark Srednicki's book "Quantum Field Theory."
