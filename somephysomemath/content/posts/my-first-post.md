Hello! I have been thinking of making a blog of some sort for a while now, but my friend Jim finally convinced me and helped me create this one. His blog can be found [here](locallytrivial.com).

My goal for this blog is baked into the name of the blog, I will talk about phyics sometimes and sometimes I will talk about math. You can expect the majority of my posts going forward to be about general relativity, quantum field theory, algebra, differential geometry, or analysis.

Each of these subject elicit different types of feelings when I think of them. For example when discussing general relativity with my peers, it gives me a sense of warmth like I am sitting infront of a hearth with a going. Discussing quantum field theory on the other hand feels more calculated, like I am working in a machine shop that requires extreme precision. I am not exactly sure of the origins of these feelings, nor why they are so disparate. 

Anyways, the focus of this blog will not be on how I feel about the subjects, but more about the actual subjects themselves. I am not quite sure of the frequency of the main posts for this blog, but I am thinking roughly once every two weeks to begin with. 

I am excited to start this journey, and can't wait to see where it goes!
