Hello! My name is Joshua Black and I am currently a PhD Candidate of the physics department at Penn State. Specifically I am a part of the Center for Theoretical and Observational Cosmology in the Institute for Gravitation and Cosmos, and my advisor is Sarah Shandera.

My research interests are related to general relativity and quantum field theory, and how they interplay in the early universe. I am also especially fond of mathematics such as algebra, differential geometry, and analysis.

If you wish to keep up with more of my day-to-day learning you can find that in my [notebook](https://somephyssomemath.com/notebook/).
