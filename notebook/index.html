<p>Hello! This is my notebook. I am planning on writing a few sentences every few days about what I have been learning about. The hope is that in after some time I will be able to look back, and be amazed at all the different things I have learned.</p>
<p>This also should help guide those who come after me. You can see the path that I took to end up where I currently am.</p>

<p>Today was the first day of classes for the day, and I am taking General Relativity II, and Quantum Field Theory II. Since it was the first day, it was mainly review, but I was for QFT we explored representations of the Poincare group, and that discussion followed the second chapter of Steven Weinbergs &ldquo;The Quantum Theory of Fields I.&rdquo; In GR we discussed extrinsic curvature, such as Gauss' Theorema Egregium, and covered the prequisites to start ADM theory.</p>

<p>I read the DeRham Cohomology part Chris J Isham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists&rdquo; and discussed it with two colleagues. I also discussed group representations, and separating the idea of a representation of a group from the group itself.</p>

<p>At this point in my career I am in my second year of my PhD. Let me recound the different major things that would be different from someone else.</p>
<p>In undergrad I majored in physics and mathematics. The math courses that I took that are relevant to me today, are proof-based linear algebra, abstract algebra, two semesters of analysis, theory of complex variables. I also took two semesters of the graduate math methods for physicist course which focused on functional analysis such as the theory of distributions, Green&rsquo;s functions, operators, and Hilbert spaces.</p>
<p>The only physics course in my undergrad that was non-standard was a course in general relativity. We went through Sean Caroll&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Spacetime and Geometry: An introduction to General Relativity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once I was in graduate school, the electives I have so far taken were the first semester of general relativity as well as the first semester of quantum field theory. For general relativity we used Carroll&rsquo;s book as the main text, but frequently deviated from it. We used tetrads frequently which do not appear in that text. For QFT we focused on the spin zero section of Mark Srednicki&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Quantum Field Theory.&rdquo;</p>
