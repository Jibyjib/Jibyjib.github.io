I have been thinking of making a blog of some sort for a while now, but my friend Jim finally convinced me and helped me create this one. His blog can be found here.
My goal for this blog is baked into the name of the blog, I will talk about phyics sometimes and sometimes I will talk about math. You can expect the majority of my posts going forward to be about general relativity, quantum field theory, algebra, differential geometry, or analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
