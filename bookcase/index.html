<p>Hello! Fun fact, I am a textbook collector, and like the aesthetics of a nice bookcase. I use it as a source of motivation when coming into the office, and hope that one day I will be one of those professors that has a nice bookcase in the future.</p>

<p>I have read this book cover to cover, and found it a good introduction to the topic. If you plan on reading all of the main texts on GR, I would say this is a good starting point.</p>
<p>It introduced all of the main topics one would be interested in, but mainly serves as an overview of the landscape, rather than a deep dive into any one topic.</p>
<p>I found the appendices enjoyable, and they are a little story of their own, once you have finished the main text. They should definitely be read sequentially because a lot of them play off the previous appendix.</p>

<p>I am working through this book currently as it is being used in my QFT course. So far I have only gotten through the first 34 chapters, but that covers the first part on scalar field theory.</p>
<p>I found the beginning of this book to be very straightforward until loop corrections started playing a role. It wasn&rsquo;t until I went back through, and had done problems that I understood what was going on for one-loop corrections. After the loop corrections I thought the rest of Part One was easier sailing.</p>

<p>So far I have read the first three chapters of this book. I have had some introduction to the subject before, but this has definitely helped me build some extra intuition. I have found a lot of the tie-ins to physics to be very nice. A lot of times books will low ball the physics knowledge, but I have found this book to use examples that are a step-up from other texts.</p>

<p>I read this book in high school, and it was my first introduction to upper level physics. I thought it was well written, and plan to reread it some time in my graduate career.</p>

<p>This book follows the life of the Baez family, where the father Albert is physicist on a UNESCO mission to teach physics in Baghdad for a year. I read this book with my father, and we both enjoyed it. It was written in a way, that my father who is not in physics, or STEM for that matter, was able to enjoy the narrative.</p>
